# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

  The purpose of this analysis is to see what factors effect vehicle performance on our cars.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
  
  We looked at 5 factors that may effect the mpg which were Spoiler Angle, vehicle weight, length, ground clearance, and all wheel drive. Based off of our linear model I listed the factors in order of positive correlation 1 being the the most important and 5 the least important
   1. Spoiler Angle
   2. All Wheel Drive
   3. Vehicle Weight
   4. vehicle length
   5. ground clearance

  The slope of our R^2 is positive

##  Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

  Currently Lot 3 does not meet design criteria, it's variance is over 100 psi, however our other two lots are well within the reccommended variance of 100 psi.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
  
  As you might expect the significant differences between the means were Lot 1 verses Lot 3 (Lot1v3) mean of differences (mean of differences = 3.86)  and Lot 2 verses lot 3 (Lot2v3) (mean of differences = 4.06), with the least differences between Lot 1 and Lot 2 (mean of differences = 0.2)
  
  


## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

  As a subject of analysis I would compare MechaCar's variance in prices for each car type (vehicle size) against the competition using the chi square tests accross dealerships.
